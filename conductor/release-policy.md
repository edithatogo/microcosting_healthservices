# Release Policy

## Purpose

Release artifacts must be reproducible, auditable, and resistant to accidental
calculator behavior drift.

## Release Types

- **Code release**: package code and helper logic.
- **Data bundle release**: bundled reference data, manifests, and checksums.
- **Validation-status release**: a change in parity, fixture, or validation
  status without a code change.

## Required Metadata

Every release should identify:

- Package version.
- Calculator data bundle version.
- Validation status.
- Source checksum set.
- Lockfile revision used for the build.
- Evidence-backed parity records for the release claim.
- For Rust artifacts, crate version, workspace lockfile revision, and binding package version.
- For browser artifacts, the build hash or package version for the generated
  fixture/demo bundle.

## Supply-Chain Controls

- Release workflows should run from a locked environment.
- Source artifact checksums must be verified before extraction or validation.
- SBOM generation should be available for published artifacts.
- Signed artifacts should be used where the distribution channel supports them.
- Rust releases should evaluate `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`, SBOM generation,
  signing, and attestations before the release claim expands.
- Renovate updates that touch calculator-impacting dependencies require review
  against the validation surface.
- GitHub Actions must pass before any push, merge, or release claim is made for
  the affected branch or tag.

## Calculator Migration Policy

Calculator migration should remain calculator-by-calculator rather than
wide-bang.

- Rust promotion requires golden fixture parity and explicit validation status.
- Python remains the default runtime path until a calculator-specific
  promotion record exists.
- Promotion records should name the calculator, pricing year, parity type,
  fixture set, tolerance, reviewer, and any known gaps.
- Canary runs, parity evidence, performance measurements, rollback guidance,
  and release-note requirements should be recorded before any Rust-backed path
  becomes default.

## Reviewer Rule

Do not merge a release that broadens a validation claim without a matching
manifest, fixture, or registry record that names the calculator, year, parity
type, fixture set, tolerance, and reviewer.
