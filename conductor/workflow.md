# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules in the short term, with a planned maturity target of >90% coverage as the library stabilizes
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.
7. **Transitional-State vs Intended-State Tooling:** Clearly distinguish temporary compatibility tooling from intended-state tooling. Do not describe legacy files, compatibility shims, or migration-only tools as authoritative once the replacement track has defined the target state.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example, in a Python project, this might look like:
   ```bash
   uv sync --locked --group dev --group test --group coverage --group typing --group property --group mutation --group profiling --group docs
   uv run pytest --cov=nwau_py --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80
   ```
   Target: >80% coverage for new code in the short term. As the library matures, raise the target toward >90% coverage, especially for core calculator logic, validation, and source-parity behavior. The specific tools and commands will vary by language and framework.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with a new design or a dated transitional-state note
   - Make it explicit whether the change is transitional-state compatibility or intended-state tooling
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`.
   - Perform the commit.

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 9.3: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command to attach the summary to the commit.
     ```bash
     # The note content from the previous step is passed via the -m flag.
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

10. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 10.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the first 7 characters of the *just-completed commit's* commit hash.
    - **Step 10.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

11. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message (e.g., `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete`).

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    -   **Step 2.1: Determine Phase Scope:** To identify the files changed in this phase, you must first find the starting point. Read `plan.md` to find the Git commit SHA of the *previous* phase's checkpoint. If no previous checkpoint exists, the scope is all changes since the first commit.
    -   **Step 2.2: List Changed Files:** Execute `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD` to get a precise list of all files modified during this phase.
    -   **Step 2.3: Verify and Create Tests:** For each file in the list:
        -   **CRITICAL:** First, check its extension. Exclude non-code files (e.g., `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`).
        -   For each remaining code file, verify a corresponding test file exists.
        -   If a test file is missing, you **must** create one. Before writing the test, **first, analyze other test files in the repository to determine the correct naming convention and testing style.** The new tests **must** validate the functionality described in this phase's tasks (`plan.md`).

3.  **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    -   Before execution, you **must** announce the exact shell command you will use to run the tests.
    -   **Example Announcement:** "I will now run the automated test suite to verify the phase. **Command:** `uv run pytest --cov=nwau_py --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml`"
    -   Execute the announced command.
    -   If tests fail, you **must** inform the user and begin debugging. You may attempt to propose a fix a **maximum of two times**. If the tests still fail after your second proposed fix, you **must stop**, report the persistent failure, and ask the user for guidance.

4.  **Run `conductor-review` and Auto-Fix:**
    -   Use the `conductor-review` skill to inspect the current phase or track against the spec, plan, workflow, tests, and changed files.
    -   Apply every high-confidence fix directly.
    -   Rerun the narrowest validation that proves the fix.
    -   Repeat the review-fix-validation loop until the work is stable or the bounded retry budget is exhausted.

5.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Stage all changes. If no changes occurred in this step, proceed with an empty commit.
    -   Perform the commit with a clear and concise message (e.g., `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`).

6.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes:**
    -   **Step 6.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the automated test command, the `conductor-review` findings, and the fixes applied.
    -   **Step 6.2: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command and the full commit hash from the previous step to attach the full report to the checkpoint commit.

7.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
    -   **Step 7.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 7.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the heading for the completed phase, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    -   **Step 7.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

8. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message following the format `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

9.  **Auto-Advance:** Once the checkpoint is recorded, automatically continue with the next incomplete task or next track. Do not pause for manual confirmation unless the workflow is blocked by missing context or a failing bounded retry.

10.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed automated review report attached as a git note.

## Development Commands

Use the locked Python commands below for setup, daily development, and pre-commit verification.

### Setup
```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group test --group coverage --group typing --group property --group mutation --group profiling --group docs
uv lock
```

### Daily Development
```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group test --group coverage --group typing --group property --group mutation --group profiling --group docs
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run ty check
uv run pytest
uv run pytest --cov=nwau_py --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80
uv run vale conductor README.md docs
```

### Slow Validation
The repository also defines a manual and scheduled slow-validation workflow for property, mutation, and profiling checks.

- Trigger it with `workflow_dispatch` or the weekly schedule in `.github/workflows/slow-validation.yml`.
- Property checks use `uv sync --locked --group test --group property` followed by `uv run pytest`.
- Mutation checks use `uv sync --locked --group test --group mutation` followed by `uv run mutmut run`.
- Profiling checks use `uv sync --locked --group test --group profiling` followed by `mkdir -p .cache/validation/scalene && uv run scalene --cli --outfile .cache/validation/scalene/scalene.out --html python -m pytest`.
- Treat `.cache/validation/scalene/` as generated output and do not commit the profiling artifacts.

### Maintenance Automation
Phase 4 treats maintenance automation as part of the quality gate, not as a separate afterthought.

- **Renovate** keeps dependency and GitHub Actions updates flowing through reviewable pull requests; treat each update as a validation event when it can affect calculator behavior, tooling, or documentation output.
- **Vale** enforces prose quality and validation-language discipline; run it locally before committing and require it to pass when phase 4 documents or claims validation status changes.
- Phase 4 is complete only when the Renovate configuration is in place, Vale is wired into the documentation gate, and the workflow text makes their roles explicit.

### Before Committing
```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group test --group coverage --group typing --group property --group mutation --group profiling --group docs
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run ty check
uv run pytest --cov=nwau_py --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80
uv run vale conductor README.md docs
