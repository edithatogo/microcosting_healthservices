# Go Binding Track Review

## Findings

1. Resolved - The track records CLI/Arrow-file interop as the initial path,
   service as fallback, and cgo as deferred until ABI and cross-compilation
   gates are stable.
2. Resolved - The track includes live contract examples, a Go scaffold, and
   tests that validate metadata, diagnostics, provenance, and no formula
   duplication.
3. Resolved - Module publication is explicitly gated and remains future-only;
   the scaffold is not a published Go module claim.

## Changed files

- `microcosting_healthservices/conductor/tracks/go_binding_20260512/review.md`

## Validation

- Static review was superseded by the integration validation recorded on the
  track commit.

## Risks

- The Go scaffold is synthetic and transport-only; it does not invoke a real
  calculator backend yet.
- Cross-compilation posture remains a documented gate until a CI matrix is
  added for specific `GOOS`/`GOARCH` targets.
- Module publication remains blocked until parity and release evidence exist.
