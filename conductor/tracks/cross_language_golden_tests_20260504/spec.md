# Specification: Cross-Language Golden Test Suite

## Goal

Create self-describing fixture packs that enforce parity across Python, future C#, and web calculation surfaces without relying on Python-specific assumptions.

## Current State

- The repository already contains one concrete pilot pack at `tests/fixtures/golden/acute_2025/`.
- That pack is synthetic and small, and it uses a JSON manifest plus CSV payloads.
- The shared runner/validator API already exists in `nwau_py.fixtures` and exposes manifest loading, pack loading, payload reading, and contract errors through `load_fixture_manifest`, `load_fixture_pack`, `read_payload_frame`, `FixtureManifestError`, and `FixtureCase`.
- The manifest vocabulary is runner-neutral. It uses fields such as `fixture_id`, `calculator`, `pricing_year`, `service_stream`, `cross_language_ready`, `privacy_classification`, `source_basis`, `payloads`, `precision`, and `provenance`.
- The current pack is intentionally shaped so shared readers can consume the same manifest and payload files across runners without Python-specific objects or harness details.
- Arrow/Parquet remain the preferred payload format for future packs where practical, but the current acute pilot pack remains CSV-backed.

## Requirements

- Fixture packs must be synthetic, small, and explicitly source traceable.
- Each fixture pack must include a committed manifest that describes calculator, pricing year, service stream, inputs, expected outputs, tolerance, rounding policy, source basis, and privacy classification.
- The current pilot pack uses CSV payloads; Arrow/Parquet remain preferred where practical for future packs that need stronger cross-language interoperability.
- The manifest must declare cross-language readiness, schema version, fixture identifiers, and any required compatibility notes.
- Fixtures must be self-describing enough that failures can report provenance, tolerance, and privacy classification without inspecting implementation code.
- The fixture format must remain stable across runners and must not encode Python-specific objects or test harness details.
- Python tests already consume the acute pilot pack through the shared manifest helper and report provenance in failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The acute_2025 synthetic pilot pack exists with a manifest and payloads.
- The fixture manifest is parseable by C#-oriented tooling without translation of the core fields.
- Privacy classification, source basis, tolerance, and rounding policy are enforced by schema validation.
- Python tests can read the pilot pack through the shared manifest contract and surface provenance in failures.
- The fixture format is suitable for web and future cross-language parity checks.
