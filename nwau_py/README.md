# nwau_py

This package provides utilities for working with IHACPA funding weights.

## Installation

The project is standardizing on `uv` for local development and validation.
Install and sync the environment with:

```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --group test --group coverage --group typing --group property --group mutation --group profiling --group docs
```

The SAS calculators for each pricing year should be extracted under
`archive/sas/<YEAR>/` so the modules can read the reference tables.

Development targets Python 3.10 through 3.14. The current quality-gate stack
uses `uv`, `Ruff`, `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ty`, `Codecov`, `Hypothesis`,
`mutmut`, `Scalene`, and on-demand `Vale` alongside the calculator
libraries. `ty` is the active type checker in this phase; `mypy` remains only
as a transitional comparator while the migration is completed. Codecov is fed
by the XML coverage artifact produced in CI so the same report can be reviewed
in the UI and in local runs.

Rust contributors should also run `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy
--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` against the
workspace under `rust/`.

The slow-validation workflow is split between a weekly scheduled run and a
manual `workflow_dispatch` run. Its profiling job writes Scalene output under
`.cache/validation/scalene/`, which keeps generated reports outside version
control while still making them easy to inspect locally.

The calculator implementation still uses pandas in places, while the
longer-term data stack is moving toward Arrow-backed interchange and Polars
where parity work allows it.

## Data preparation

The Python calculators load tables directly from the SAS releases archived under
`archive/sas/<YEAR>/`. If you need the original Excel workbook outputs, the
helper script `excel_calculator/scripts/extract_all.py` can recreate
`weights.csv` and `formula.json` from the workbooks stored in
`excel_calculator/archive/<year>`.

## CLI usage

Once installed you can calculate funding from the command line using the
`nwau_py` CLI:

```bash
python -m nwau_py.cli.main acute patient_data.csv --output funding.csv --year 2025
```

`patient_data.csv` should contain the variables expected by the SAS programs.
The output CSV will include an `NWAU25` column with the calculated weights.

## Validation Workflow

The package is validated through manifest-driven fixture packs and explicit
parity checks rather than broad claims of complete coverage. Use the shared
fixture helpers in `nwau_py.fixtures` to load packs, read payloads, and run
runner-neutral checks that can later be consumed by Python, C#, and web
tooling.

For the acute 2025 pilot there is also an explicit Rust-backed opt-in path,
`nwau_py.calculators.calculate_acute_rust_2025()`, which loads the optional
`nwau_py._rust` extension through `nwau_py.rust_bridge` and returns the same
`NWAU25` values for the synthetic fixture pack without changing the default
Python calculator path.

## Formula JSON

The file `excel_calculator/data/formula.json` is a structured representation of
the workbook formula used by IHACPA and is kept for archival purposes. It lists
each symbol (for example `PW`, `APaed`, `AInd`) and the corresponding column
heading in `excel_calculator/data/weights.csv`. A full mapping is provided in
[`FORMULA_MAPPING.md`](../excel_calculator/data/FORMULA_MAPPING.md).

The `steps` array enumerates the intermediate calculations that build up the
final `NWAU25` value. Starting from the base price weight, paediatric and other
adjustments are applied, ICU hours are added, private patient adjustments and
readmission penalties are subtracted and the result is multiplied by the
National Efficient Price (`NEP`). The last step yields the overall `NWAU25`
figure used for funding.

## Documentation

Detailed notes on each calculator module are available in [docs/calculators.md](docs/calculators.md).

## Golden Fixture Packs

The project uses manifest-driven fixture packs for cross-language parity checks.
The current pilot pack lives under `tests/fixtures/golden/acute_2025/` and includes
a JSON manifest plus `input.csv` and `expected.csv` payloads.

Use `nwau_py.fixtures` to work with these packs:

- `load_fixture_pack()` validates the manifest and resolves payload paths.
- `discover_fixture_packs()` finds packs under a fixture root.
- `read_payload_frame()` loads the manifest-declared input or expected output tables.
- `iter_fixture_cases()` maps manifests to calculator cases.
- `fixture_case_params()` turns cases into pytest parameters with stable ids.
- `iter_fixture_pytest_params_from_root()` discovers packs and generates pytest parameters from manifest metadata.
- `run_fixture_case()` executes a calculator against one manifest case.
- `run_fixture_suite()` executes and validates a set of cases.
- `run_fixture_suite_from_root()` discovers packs and runs every valid case in order.
- `assert_fixture_case_output()` checks the result against the declared tolerance and rounding policy.

Pytest coverage is generated from the same manifests by parameterizing over the
discovered fixture cases. That keeps the test matrix and the helper runner in
sync without hard-coding runner-specific logic.
