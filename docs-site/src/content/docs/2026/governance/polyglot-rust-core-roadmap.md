title: Polyglot Rust core roadmap
slug: 2026/governance/polyglot-rust-core-roadmap
---

Python remains the validated public runtime while the project moves toward a
shared Rust calculator core with thin bindings. This page is a roadmap and
contract summary; it is not a claim that Rust is already the default runtime.

## Target architecture

The intended end state is one Rust calculator core exposed through thin
surfaces for Python, Rust, R, Julia, C#/.NET, Go, TypeScript/WASM, Java/JVM,
C ABI, SQL/DuckDB, SAS interoperability, CLI/file workflows, web demos, and
Power Platform orchestration.

Formula logic must stay single-sourced. Bindings, apps, notebooks, SQL
extensions, and low-code assets may translate inputs and present outputs, but
they must not duplicate calculator math.

## Promotion lifecycle

Each calculator stream advances independently:

1. Python baseline.
2. Rust canary.
3. Rust opt-in.
4. Rust default.

Rust default requires fixture parity, packaging evidence, documentation, and
binding contracts for that stream. Evidence from one stream does not promote
another stream.

## Contract surfaces

The roadmap contract is versioned at
`contracts/polyglot-rust-core-roadmap/polyglot-rust-core-roadmap.contract.json`.

It covers:

* Arrow-compatible batch input and output.
* Machine-readable diagnostics.
* Provenance and checksum fields.
* Validation status semantics.
* Binding conformance expectations.
* ABI boundary expectations.
* Synthetic fixture gates.

## Packaging and release surfaces

The package roadmap distinguishes current, preview, private, release-candidate,
and general-availability states. Python is the current validated public
runtime. Rust crates, C ABI, TypeScript/WASM, SQL/DuckDB, CLI/file, R, Julia,
NuGet/C#, Go, JVM, SAS interop, web demos, and Power Platform managed
solutions each need their own release gate before public support claims.

## Non-overclaiming rule

Public docs should say "Python baseline" unless a stream has explicit Rust
parity evidence. Public docs should say "Rust canary" or "Rust opt-in" only
when the stream has the matching validation record. Public docs should say
"Rust default" only after parity, packaging, fallback, and release evidence are
complete for that stream.
