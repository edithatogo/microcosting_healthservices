# C#/.NET Binding Roadmap

Roadmap snapshot: 2026-05-13.

This document compares the candidate integration strategies for the C#/.NET
binding workstream and records the initial path, fallback, and guardrails. It
is roadmap-only: it does not introduce formula logic, and it does not claim a
production-ready binding.

## Scope

- Provide a C#/.NET integration path for institutional services,
  health-service applications, and Power Platform-adjacent workloads.
- Keep the shared Rust core as the only source of formula logic.
- Use the .NET surface for transport, packaging, diagnostics, and host
  integration only.

## Comparison

| Strategy | Strengths | Costs | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C ABI / PInvoke | Lowest call overhead for in-process consumers; good fit for desktop or service hosts that can load native libraries directly. | Requires stable native packaging, strict ABI compatibility, and careful memory-ownership rules. It is the most brittle option when the contract is still moving. | Latency-sensitive .NET hosts that need direct in-process calls after the ABI is stable. |
| Service boundary | Easiest way to keep the formula engine single-sourced; clean versioning and diagnostics; aligns well with cloud, enterprise, and Power Platform integration. | Adds process and network hops; needs service availability, auth, and operational support. | Initial .NET rollout when the contract is still stabilizing and Power Platform adjacency matters. |
| CLI / Arrow-file interop | Strong for batch, auditability, reproducibility, and offline handoff. The file contract is easy to inspect and fixture-test. | Slower than in-process calls and less ergonomic for interactive .NET consumers. | Fallback path for batch workflows, offline use, and environments that cannot depend on a live service. |

## Decision

Start with the **service boundary** as the initial C#/.NET strategy.

Use **CLI / Arrow-file interop** as the fallback when a caller needs batch
execution, offline handoff, or a more inspectable contract than a live service
can provide.

Defer **C ABI / PInvoke** until the native ABI, packaging, and compatibility
rules are stable enough to justify an in-process surface.

## Why the service boundary comes first

- It keeps the calculator formulas in one place.
- It avoids forcing native DLL distribution before the contract is stable.
- It lines up with enterprise deployment patterns where .NET apps, services,
  and Power Platform solutions already communicate through approved endpoints.
- It allows the team to reuse the same diagnostics, provenance, and fixture
  contract across consumers.

## Power Platform adjacency

- Power Platform is an orchestration surface, not a place to host calculator
  formulas.
- A service boundary is the natural adjacency point because managed solutions,
  connectors, and flows can call a versioned endpoint without embedding the
  business logic.
- If a Power Platform scenario needs batch or governed file exchange, the same
  contract can fall back to the CLI / Arrow-file path.
- Any Power Platform-facing component must remain thin and route work to the
  shared contract rather than duplicate calculator rules in expressions,
  flows, or app code.

## No formula-logic duplication

- The Rust core remains the single source of formula logic.
- C# models may mirror request and response shapes, but they may not
  reimplement calculator rules, adjustment logic, or fallback heuristics.
- The service layer may validate, route, authenticate, and translate payloads,
  but it may not become a second calculator.
- File interchange may serialize canonical inputs and outputs, but it may not
  introduce a parallel calculation path.

## Sequencing guidance

1. Stabilize the service contract and shared diagnostics first.
2. Wire .NET clients to the service boundary and keep them thin.
3. Use CLI / Arrow-file interop for batch or offline scenarios that need a
   safer handoff than in-process code.
4. Promote C ABI / PInvoke only after the ABI and packaging rules are stable
   and there is a clear latency or embedding need.

## Validation rule

- Every .NET example must validate against shared golden fixtures.
- A .NET binding that duplicates formula constants, thresholds, or adjustment
  rules is out of scope.
- Release claims for NuGet packaging should wait until the chosen boundary is
  stable and parity evidence exists for the shared contract.
