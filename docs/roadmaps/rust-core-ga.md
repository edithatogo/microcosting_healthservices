# Rust Core GA Roadmap

This roadmap makes the Rust calculator core the immediate priority. Downstream
language and interoperability tracks are deferred until the core reaches a
validated release-candidate state.

## Goal

Promote Rust from future/preview target to the GA runtime for supported
calculator streams, with Python retained as the baseline reference and fallback
until each stream has complete parity evidence.

## Non-negotiable GA principles

- Rust owns formula execution for promoted streams.
- Python remains the reference baseline until a stream is promoted.
- Bindings, notebooks, apps, and language packages stay thin.
- Source manifests, formula bundles, coding-set registries, fixtures,
  diagnostics, and provenance are versioned inputs to the core.
- No stream becomes Rust-default without SAS/Excel/source parity evidence where
  those reference artefacts exist.
- No public package or documentation claim may outrun release evidence.

## Deprioritized work

The following tracks are valid future work but are not immediate priorities:

- Scala/Spark Binding
- Swift Binding
- Stata Interoperability
- MATLAB Interoperability

They should remain boundary-only roadmap items until the Rust core reaches
release-candidate status and the C ABI/CLI/file contracts are stable enough for
additional consumers.

## Phase 0: Governance freeze

Purpose: stop scope drift while the core is promoted.

Exit gates:

- Roadmap declares Rust Core GA as the immediate priority.
- Open language-interoperability tracks are explicitly deferred.
- Release claims distinguish `private`, `preview`, `release-candidate`, and
  `ga`.
- Documentation states that adapters cannot implement formula logic.

## Phase 1: Contract and data foundation

Purpose: make every core input explicit and versioned.

Deliverables:

- Versioned calculator contract schemas.
- Versioned source manifests for supported streams and pricing years.
- Versioned formula and parameter bundles.
- Versioned coding-set and classification registries.
- Arrow-compatible batch input/output schemas.
- Stable diagnostics, errors, and provenance schemas.

Exit gates:

- Schemas are exported and validated in CI.
- Fixture packs identify source artefacts, checksums, expected outputs, and
  licensing/redistribution status.
- Missing or unavailable source artefacts produce blocked status rather than
  inferred support.

## Phase 2: Rust kernel architecture

Purpose: implement the calculator core without duplicating language-specific
business logic.

Deliverables:

- Rust crate workspace for core types, formula kernels, registries,
  diagnostics, provenance, and CLI/file execution.
- Stream modules isolated behind stable traits.
- Decimal/money/weight precision policy.
- Deterministic error model.
- No patient-level data or proprietary reference tables committed.

Exit gates:

- Rust code path can execute synthetic fixtures for at least one end-to-end
  canary stream/year.
- Core APIs are thin enough for Python, CLI/file, C ABI, and WASM consumers.
- Formula logic is not implemented in bindings.

## Phase 3: Parity and validation

Purpose: prove correctness stream by stream.

Validation hierarchy:

1. Source/schema conformance.
2. Golden synthetic fixtures.
3. SAS/Excel parity where public or locally licensed reference artefacts exist.
4. Python baseline parity.
5. Cross-surface parity for CLI/file and Python binding.
6. Regression and mutation tests for edge cases.

Exit gates:

- At least one representative stream/year completes the full evidence ladder.
- Every supported stream has a parity status: `blocked`, `canary`, `opt-in`,
  `release-candidate`, or `ga`.
- Coverage target for GA streams is greater than 90 percent over the Rust core
  and validation-critical adapters.

## Phase 4: Delivery surfaces required for GA

Purpose: expose the core through stable minimum surfaces before widening the
language matrix.

Required surfaces:

- Rust crate.
- CLI/file contract.
- Python binding with fallback controls.
- C ABI headers and ownership rules.
- Arrow/Parquet batch interchange.

Deferred surfaces:

- Scala/Spark.
- Swift.
- Go.
- MATLAB.
- SQL/DuckDB.
- Any additional language adapter not required for GA validation.

Exit gates:

- Required surfaces have contract tests and release artefacts.
- Fallback and rollback behavior is documented and tested.
- No deferred surface is needed for the first GA release.

## Phase 5: CI/CD, release, and security hardening

Purpose: make GA reproducible.

Deliverables:

- Rust formatting, linting, typing-equivalent checks, docs, and security scans.
- Cross-platform build matrix for supported targets.
- Coverage upload through the Codecov app.
- SBOM and provenance artefacts.
- Signed tags and release notes.
- Package publishing dry-run and production release workflow.
- Docs deployment with Starlight.

Exit gates:

- CI passes on protected main.
- Release artefacts are reproducible from CI.
- Security and dependency scans have no unresolved high-severity blockers.
- Documentation, package metadata, homepage, and release notes agree on support
  status.

## Phase 6: Release-candidate to GA promotion

Purpose: promote conservatively, with rollback.

Release-candidate gates:

- Rust path is opt-in for supported streams.
- Parity evidence is attached to the release.
- Python fallback remains available.
- Known limitations are documented.

GA gates:

- Rust path is default for promoted streams.
- No open parity gaps exist for supported cases.
- Rollback procedure is documented and tested.
- Public docs and package metadata state exact supported streams and years.
- A post-release monitoring and issue triage plan exists.

## Immediate implementation order

1. Create the Rust Core GA Conductor track.
2. Freeze language-adapter expansion behind the Rust Core GA track.
3. Define the audience language strategy for researchers and enterprise engineers.
4. Export and validate canonical contract schemas.
5. Define CLI/file contracts.
6. Define the HTTP API contract.
7. Define the MCP contract.
8. Define the OpenAI tool adapter as a thin integration layer.
9. Implement the Rust workspace and one representative stream/year canary.
10. Add parity validation against Python and available SAS/Excel artefacts.
11. Harden required delivery surfaces.
12. Promote one stream/year to release-candidate.
13. Promote to GA only after evidence and release automation pass.

## Parallel implementation lanes

The roadmap is intentionally parallelisable. Agents can work concurrently when
their write scopes and contracts are separated:

- Lane A: canonical schemas, support status, diagnostics, errors, and
  provenance.
- Lane B: Rust core crate, kernel traits, registries, CLI/file execution, and
  fixture execution.
- Lane C: CLI/file, HTTP API, MCP, and OpenAI adapter contracts generated from
  canonical schemas.
- Lane D: HWAU terminology, national/state/local price registries, NSW model,
  jurisdiction models, and parallel valuation outputs.
- Lane E: documentation, evidence bundles, release automation, CI/CD, and
  security gates.

No lane may redefine formula logic, bypass canonical schemas, or mark support
as complete without the required evidence gates.

## Definition of done

Rust Core GA is complete only when at least one declared calculator stream/year
is defaulting to Rust in a public release, the evidence bundle is attached to
that release, Starlight documentation is published, and unsupported streams are
clearly marked as unavailable, blocked, canary, or opt-in.
